     A test frame is an include file (. inc) that serves as a central global repository of 
information about the application under test. It contains all the data structures that 
support your test cases and test scripts.
     Frameworks helps in 
   a) maintaining a common structure across the organization 
   b) sharing of projects is easy since the test frame have a central repository file while 
      automatically help in downloading jars for who want to clone the project.
   c) manual configuration like downloading jars and adding them to the projects is not needed.
   d) provides organized way from creation of base class to generate reports.
   
   Test frameworks supported by Selenium webdriver are:
   1) Keyword driven: Here user inputs are given from outer source files like spreadsheet/excel
   2) Data driven: Here user inputs are given from TestNG's data-provider annotation and I have 
   				   followed this framework in this project.
   3)Hybrid : It is a mix of both keyword and data driven framework.
